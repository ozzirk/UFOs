# UFOs

**Overview** 
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sighting data by allowing users to filter via multiple criteria. This will allow the data set to be more usable, as it will be easier to parse through the data. 


**Results**

The new webpage now features a multi-criteria search that will allow you to be as specific as you need to be! To use the filters, enter in the criteria into each search box. We can filter based on date, city, state, country, and shape of sighting. Once your specific criteria is input, hit enter and the search results will be shown. To reset the filters and start another query, click the 'UFO Sightings' heading a the top left of the page.  

**Summary**

In summary, this is a great improvement which allows the data to be more usable. A downside of this new design is that the removal of the filter button and use of enter to search may not be as intuitive as the original design.

Two recommendations for further development would be:
1. Selection from available data for each filter field, so users can know before they query what information is in the dataset
2. An option to export the filtered data for further analysis
